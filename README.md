# Laila-Diet
Laila loves food. However, she is currently on a diet. The nutrition specialist put her on a
special diet in which she eats only one meal per day! Her meal must belong to one of the
following three types: (i) Carbohydrates. (ii) Protein and (iii) V&A (Vitamins and Minerals).

Whenever she eats a certain meal she gains a certain amount of calories. Different meals
result in different calories depending on the day and depending on the type. For example
when eating meal no. 1 in the Carbohydrates type, Laila gains a different amount of calories
compared to eating meal no. 1 in the Protein type. Also when eating meal no. 1 in the
Carbohydrates type, Laila gains a different amount of calories compared to meal no. 2 or
meal no. 3 from the Carbohydrates category and so on.

The diet is designed to last N days (from day 1 to day N). Each day Laila can choose any
meal she likes from any of the 3 types, however, she is not allowed to select two meals of the
same type in two consecutive days. Also, if Laila selects a certain meal, she is not allowed to
select the same meal again.

we should find the minimum amount of calories needed by Laila to finish the N days of the diet.
